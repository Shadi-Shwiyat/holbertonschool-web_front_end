## Learning Objectives
- What is Flexbox?
- How to convert float positioning to a flex display
- How to horizontally and vertically align elements using Flexbox
- The difference between the main and cross axes
- Properties that work on flex elements vs flex container
- Shorthands for flex

## Tasks
0. Add display flex
    Use the starter HTML and CSS files from this task to task 10. Copy the contents of the starter files into the files that you need to produce and make the necessary changes according to the task description.

    When using display: flex; on a container, all direct children become flex-items (and no more inline or block elements).

    With display flex, margins are not collapsing as they would with block items. Also remember that flexbox is 1-dimensional system (vs CSS Grid which is a 2 dimensional system)

    In the /* Grid section within your CSS
    - Add a selector for the row class
        - Property: display, Value: flex
    => Now, all children from the row class are flex items
    - Entirely remove the row::after declaration
    - Remove the float: left inside [class*='col-']
    => All elements should appear same than before using the float
